/* freespa provides an implementation of the SPA (solar position 
 * algorithm). A document decribing the algorithm can be found on 
 * NREL's website:
 * https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/spa/
 * 
 * The purpose of this implementation is to overcome licensing issues 
 * with NREL's spa. NREL's spa cannot be redistributed (sort of "free 
 * as in beer you may not share with your friends"). This 
 * implementation you can share under the GPLv3. 
 * 
 * NREL's spa is built around the algorithms found in:
 * Meeus, J., 1998. Astronomical Algorithms, second ed. Willmann-Bell, 
 * Inc., Richmond, Virginia, USA.
 */

/* Requirement:
 * we require a 64bit signed integer time_t type, which limits the 
 * portability somewhat.
 * 
 * Note to self:
 * Pehaps I should use just a signed 64bit integer type instead of 
 * time_t? I suppose it would make the code more portable but 
 * interfacing with the standard time handling routines more awkward. 
 * 
 * Background:
 * The problem of time_t is that there is no good standard for it.
 * In ISO C `time_t` is specified as either an integer or 
 * floating-point type, and even the meaning to `time_t` is not 
 * specified (i.e. it may not be seconds since the epoch). On POSIX-
 * conformant systems `time_t` is required to ba an integer type, but 
 * it may still be 32bit or unsigned. The GNU C library uses signed 
 * integers and negative numbers are interpreted as dates before the 
 * epoch (as freespa does too). Also 64bit windows systems use a signed 
 * 64bit integer as the time_t type(1). Thus at least on those two 
 * 64bit platforms freespa should work. 
 * 
 * (1) Beware, on windows the gmtime routines do not work for dates
 * before Jan 01 00:00:00 1970, and for dates after 
 * Dec 31 23:59:59 3000. As far as I can tell these limits are 
 * completely arbitrary. The upper limit is probably not so relevant. 
 * However, I find it hard to understand why Microsoft engineers 
 * deliberately criple these routines so they cannot handle birthdays 
 * before 1970... What were they thinking, sod those old bastards?
 * If you have to handle a birthday before 1970 on a MS system you may 
 * use freespa's gmjtime routines instead.

 * Gregorian calendar starts on October 15, 1582.
 * 
 * This definition of unix time makes it compatible with the julian day 
 * as it is computed from a date in freespa, i.e. the julian days all 
 * have 86400 seconds.
